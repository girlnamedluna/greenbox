- Not encrypted with SoftYellowENCDE
- Password file in plaintext located in (If not, message me at girlnamedluna on discord) "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\OneDrive\Desktop\GreenBox Export" or possibly "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Desktop\GreenBox Export"
- If something does not work message me, if something is not clear please message me

For Encryption
- You should not 'optionally encrypt' your file before you have a list of passwords that you have used
- Do not lose your encryption key, write it down physically for the best level of security or write it in a text file on your desktop without saying what it is
- Encryption key and contents will change every time so the same encryption key will not work twice over

Possible usage for when to encrypt your passwords (i.e.: Only encrypt when the passwords are used and you do not plan on making anymore at that time)
(Passwords shows are not used by me, do not try)
