- Password file in plaintext located in (If not, message me at girlnamedluna on discord) "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\OneDrive\Desktop\GreenBox Export" or possibly "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Desktop\GreenBox Export"
- If something does not work message me on discord, if something is not clear please message me on discord

In regards of generalized GreenBox usage
- Navigate to core/, inside there should be a shortcut titled Greenbox.exe, running the shortcut should generate the file / folder needed to run GreenBox.
- Running GreenBox.exe will generate ONE password, it must be ran multiple times to generate multiple passwords (See updates at bottom)
- Make sure that you press ENTER until the command prompt closes on it's own, otherwise the code may not execute fully

In regards of ENcryption
- To encrypt your GreenBoxExport.txt file with your passwords and/or other sensitive data, run GreenBox.exe and select y to optionally encrypt your file
- When running GreenBox.exe it will ask if you would like to optionally encrypt your file, if this is the first time you have run it and want to use your passwords, do not select yes.
- You should not 'optionally encrypt' your file before you have a list of passwords that you have used
- !! Do not lose your encryption key, write it down physically for the best level of security or write it in a text file on your desktop without saying what it is !!
- Encryption key and contents will change every time so the same encryption key will not work twice over
- Make sure that you press ENTER until the command prompt closes on it's own, otherwise the code may not execute fully

In regards of DEcryption
- Navigate to core/, inside there should be a shortcut titled SoftYellowDEC.exe, running the shortcut should open a command propmt

Possible usage for when to encrypt your passwords (i.e.: Only encrypt when the passwords are used and you do not plan on making anymore at that time)
(Passwords shows are not used by me, do not try)

In regards of updates for GreenBox
At some point in the future, the hope is these updates will be included but are not guarenteed
- Make GreenBoxExport.txt and the parent folder naturally be inside of /core instead of in the user's desktop if possible
- Make GreenBox.exe allow the user to type a number of passwords that they want to create all at once instead of having to run the .exe multiple times over
